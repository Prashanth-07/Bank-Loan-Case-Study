# Bank Loan Case Study

## Role Description:
As a data analyst in a financial institution specializing in urban client loans, my role involves addressing loan defaults by clients with limited credit history. Utilizing exploratory data analysis (EDA), I aim to identify data patterns to ensure that deserving candidates are not declined. üìäüíº

## Project Design
### Approach:
Leverage Microsoft Excel for comprehensive data analysis, applying formulas for solutions.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Import:** Gather and import loan-related data into Microsoft Excel.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Ensure data accuracy by addressing discrepancies and missing values.
3. **Data Exploration:** Investigate data patterns to uncover factors contributing to loan defaults.
4. **Data Analysis:** Utilize Excel formulas for in-depth analysis of credit history, loan types, and client demographics.
5. **Visual Representation:** Create compelling visualizations in Excel to effectively communicate findings.
6. **Recommendations:** Formulate strategies to mitigate defaults and ensure deserving clients are not turned away.

### Tools and Resources:
- Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization.

## Findings
### Task: Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.
- Used conditional formatting to find out the blanks more than 50% and remove them.

### Task: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.

### Task: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.

### Task: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.

### Targeted Credit Usage:
The analysis reveals distinct credit usage patterns among different segments. Specifically, it highlights a notable increase in credit usage among a specific demographic group, indicating a potential market opportunity for targeted financial products or services in this segment.

### Income vs. Credit Amount:
Higher income levels correspond to larger credit amounts, indicating a positive correlation. Tailoring credit offerings based on income can optimize credit utilization and repayment.

### Task: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
- Here, conditional formatting is used to differentiate between lowest, midpoint, and highest values using tri-colors.

## Key Insights and Conclusion
### Task 1: Missing Data Handling
- Conditional formatting identified blanks exceeding 50%, ensuring data completeness.

### Task 2: Outlier Detection
- Conditional formatting and charts exposed outliers, critical for robust analysis.

### Task 3: Data Imbalance Assessment
- Calculated data imbalance ratio, highlighting potential modeling challenges.

### Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis provided essential insights.

### Task 5: Correlation in Segmented Data
- Segmentation revealed segment-specific correlations, aiding tailored strategies.

In summary, EDA using Excel uncovered valuable insights, facilitating data-driven decisions for loan approval and risk management.

## Conclusion
Our EDA journey using Excel functions and features has unearthed vital insights. We tackled missing data, spotted outliers, gauged data imbalance, and unraveled variable relationships. These revelations guide our loan approval, risk management, and tailored strategies. EDA in Excel remains our compass for data-driven decisions. üíºüìàüîç
